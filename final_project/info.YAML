  This program will visualize fashion trends over time, using a collection of text files containing articles, 
  which have then been analyzed using our program to hold certian datapoints via csv rows. The UI will allow users to input 
  a fashion article and display a graph comparing the prevalance of certian articles of clothing in the article.
  Meanwhile a text based command line interaction allows for article comparison, seeing how many times a
  certian article appears in different fashion texts from different months.
  The visual representation will be created using OCamlâ€™s built-in libraries for data visualization, 
  and users will interact with the program via a mixture of the command line and the gui.
