Title: SS25 Trend: Mod squad, mini skirts, A-line dresses and geometric prints
Date: Dec 4, 2024

loading... People are increasingly looking to the past for inspiration, especially as social media amplifies nostalgia-driven trends. In the early to mid-‘sixties, ‘mod’ was short for "modernist," and was a movement characterized by a focus on forward-thinking fashion and music; most likely as a response to the often dreary landscape of post-World War II British culture. The designs of Mary Quant et al, as modeled by Twiggy and Jean Shrimpton, resonated in both The UK and in The USA.
‘Mod’ fashion, with its sharp tailoring, geometric patterns, and vibrant color palettes, carried a sense of optimism and rebellion that feels fresh and exciting in today's world, and certainly made its mark on the SS25 season.
