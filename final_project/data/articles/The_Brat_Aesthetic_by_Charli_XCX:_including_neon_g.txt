Title: The Brat Aesthetic by Charli XCX: including neon green, white tank tops and Kamala Harris
Date: Aug 2, 2024

loading... When President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race and endorsed V.P. Kamala Harris to replace him, singer Charli XCX tweeted, “kamala is brat,” and it broke the Internet. The excitement that engendered was the culmination of something that had been brewing since the album ‘brat’ with its neon green cover was released on June 7. Charli revealed on Instagram that she “narrowed down around 65 shades of green” to achieve “the final, most ultimate, most brat green.”
The Harris campaign even changed their X banner to a blurry black text on a neon green background. Then, just when it seemed that Brat mania couldn’t get any wilder, actor and influencer Kelley Heyer created a dance to the song ‘Apple’ from the Brat album that went viral on TikTok. So what is included in the brat wardrobe? When asked to explain brat style Charli stated via a Tiktok video that it’s “all about duality. It can go the way of quiet luxury but it can also be trashy,” she continued, “a strappy white top with no bra, that’s kind of all you need.” If you are seeking further styling inspiration, here are recent images from street style and the runways that fit the bill.
