Organic retailer and B Corp lifestyle brand Erewhon has launched an exclusive apparel collection just in time for the holiday season.

Highlighting the company’s success in establishing a flagship lifestyle brand, rooted in a market that has set new benchmarks in the grocery industry since the 1960s, the new collection includes everyday staples such as a zip hoodie, pullover hoodies, crewneck, sweatpants, socks, hat and bag, all with Erewhon’s signature branding.

Available in five colorways, including tomato, plum, and butterscotch, the entire collection is also made from an organic collection blend, in line with the brand’s commitment to quality. As of yesterday, Erewhon Members were granted an exclusive 24-hour preview to purchase items from the apparel collection before it was released to the public. The Erewhon Membership program offers two tiers, providing benefits such as exclusive discounts, complimentary beverages and smoothies, invitations to wellness events, and more.

The new apparel collection is part of the brand’s Winter ‘24 collection, and Erewhon is entering new markets and product categories outside of its brick-and-mortar business in Southern California. All of the items in the apparel collection are available for online purchase with worldwide shipping options. Over the past year, Erewhon has broadened this segment of its business by offering more non-perishable products designed to attract a global audience outside of Los Angeles.

Erewhon is a family-owned Certified B Corp and Organic Retailer with 10 Southern California locations. Providing organic, ethically sourced foods since 1968, the brand is committed to quality, sustainability, and supporting local growers.
